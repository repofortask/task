# About solution
This solution gives opportunities to run two containers where the first container is the database and the second is python interpretation where you can do some data manipulation. 

# Files and folders
In Analytics you can find files that contain python script and Jupyter notebook with the same script. 
In DB you can find some of the .csv files that are imported to Postres when the container is upping. 

# How to run
```
Docker-compose up
```
Then open the link that you can find in a terminal with token later you can choose the analytics.ipynb where you can try to select some data from the database in another container.
